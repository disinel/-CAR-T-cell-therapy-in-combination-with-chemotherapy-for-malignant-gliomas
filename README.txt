Code repository accompanying Dmitry Sinelschikov, Juan Belmonte-Beitia, Matteo Italia.
A mathematical model of CAR-T cell therapy in combination with chemotherapy for malignant gliomas. (manuscript submitted for review, 2025).

This repository contains the codes developed in Matlab to simulate the interactions between sensitive, resistance to TMZ, resistance to CAR-T therapy tumor cells, CAR-T cells,  and TMZ drug applied to glioblastoma, a fatal tumor brain.


**ABOUT THE CODES**

Each folder contains the necessary codes to generate the figures in the article. Each folder is named after the figure it represents in the article. For example, the folder "fig.2" contains the codes required to generate Figure 2.

Within each folder, the codes have self-explanatory names that indicate their function. For instance, in the "fig.2" folder, the code used to generate Figure 2 is named "generate_fig2.m". This code calls auxiliary scripts and uses data to generate the corresponding figure.

The same structure applies to the rest of the folders.
